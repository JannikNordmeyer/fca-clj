# brunt --- a conexp-clj based command line tool for computing formal concepts and more

A command line tool for some functions of the [conexp-clj](https://github.com/tomhanika/conexp-clj) tool for Formal Concept Analysis.

## Usage

The standalone jar (in builds/uberjar) can be used via:

    $ java -jar brunt-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

The following options may be used:

```
-f, --function FUNCTION 	Specifies Function to be executed.
-h, --help 			Displays Intruction Texts.
```

All supported Functions, as well as their necessary arguments can be displayed by executing:

    $ java -jar brunt-0.1.0-standalone.jar -h

The Arguments of a specific function can be display with:

    $ java -jar brunt-0.1.0-standalone.jar -h [function]

## Example

There is an example context given in the testing-data folder. To draw an image of a concept lattice, the following command can be used (directly from the fca-clj directory):

    $ java -jar builds/uberjar/brunt-0.1.0-standalone.jar -f draw-concept-lattice testing-data/living-beings-and-water.ctx

Note that the file path from the current directory needs to be specified to access the jar file.

## Arguments

Arguments such as sets need to be specified in string form, by encasing them in the " character.
A set of integers may be input like this:

    $ "#{1 2 3}"

In case strings are provided as entries to a set, they need to be encases as well. For this to be interpreted correctly, the inner " need to be escaped using the \ character:

    $ "#{\"a\" \"b\" \"c\"}"
